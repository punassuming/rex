This package is designed to do the following:


Develop a method to extract the following information from an excel file:

	Process parameters
	Data file name

From this information, the script will then parse the available data into individual curves

We can then:

	Develop process dependant analysis on the data
	Plot the data with premade custom graphs
		(Labbook) - 8X10 subplots (.png)
	Have smart labels developed from the process paramters
	Save the resultant curves in a .xls file for subsequent analysis in excel
	Save the resultant curves in a .dat file for easy import in the future
	Save the results of the experimental anlaysis in a second sheet in excel
	
There is an additional command line tool to provide fast custom plots with the plotting commands found in this package.
Additionally, with this tool we can submit the processed .dat file to obtain quick plotting
